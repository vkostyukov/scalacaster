 * Merge Sort http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergesort
 *
 * Worst - O(n log n)
 * Best - O(n log n)
 * Average - O(n log n)
 *
 * -Notes-
 *
 * Using mergesort is a common way to sort a singly-linked list in a functional environment.
 * This implementation fits into standard requirements about performance. The only difference
 * here with default imperative implementation is a way how to split a list into two parts.
 * This commonly solved by using length of the list, which costs O(n) since requires to walk
 * from the start to the end of this. In this implementation, list is splitted into two equal
 * parts by using 'halfify' function. This function perform very simple thing - it takes first
 * two elements of the list and appends them to two separate lists, which accumulate the result.
 * In other words, this function append all even nodes into first part, while odd nodes into the
 * second one. This can be done in O(n).
